## Execution Environment<br /> 
Operation System: Microsoft Windows 10, 64bit.<br />
Physical Memory (RAM) 16.0 GB.<br />
### Prerequisites<br /> 
JDK 1.8- Java Development Kit comprising of Java Runtime Environment to execute java applications.<br />
IFogSim simulator for experimental set up and execution.<br />
# Installation of IFogSim Simulator <br /> 
Simulator is available in github repository : **https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim**. <br />Clone the repository in Eclipse IDE and follow the instructions to run the IFogSim simulator provided in the github link.<br />For more details you can refer to the IFogsim Documentation[1].<br />
One example video about installation for your reference:**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_I-fzHY6qQ**<br />
# Usage of the repository folder<br /> 
Download  DelayPOMCD and keep it in the drive where IFogsim-main is present. The  DelayPOMCD repository contains all executable files related to the proposed and baseline approaches.<br />
proposed.java -> The Main file related to the  Proposed Algorithm approach.<br />
DATSfinal.java -> The Main file related to the  DATS baseline approach.<br />
post_new.java -> The Main file related to the  POST game theory based approach.<br />
Random.java -> The Main file related to the random offloading approach.<br />  
In generator_new.java, we can set the various parameters related to Partial Offloading Simulation as specified in Table 2 Simulation parameters in the paper.<br />
