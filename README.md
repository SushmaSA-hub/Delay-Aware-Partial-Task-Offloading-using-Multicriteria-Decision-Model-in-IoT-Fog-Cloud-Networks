# Delay-Aware-Partial-Task-Offloading-using-Multicriteria-Decision-Model-in-IoT-Fog-Cloud-Networks

## Execution Environment

Operation System: Microsoft Windows 10, 64bit.

Physical Memory (RAM) 16.0 GB.

### Prerequisites

-JDK 1.8- Java Development Kit comprising of Java Runtime Environment to execute java applications.

-IFogSim simulator for experimental set up and execution.

# Installation of IFogSim Simulator 

Simulator is available in github repository : **https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim**. 

Clone the repository in Eclipse IDE and follow the instructions to run the IFogSim simulator provided in the github link.

For more details you can refer to the IFogsim Documentation [1].

One example video about installation for your reference:**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_I-fzHY6qQ**

### Usage of the repository folder:

Download  DelayPOMCD and keep it in the drive where IFogsim-main is present. The  DelayPOMCD repository contains all executable files related to the proposed and baseline approaches.

-> In proposed.java -> The Main file related to the  Proposed Algorithm approach.

-> DATSfinal.java -> The Main file related to the  DATS baseline approach[2].

-> post_new.java -> The Main file related to the  POST game theory based approach[3].

-> Random.java -> The Main file related to the random offloading approach.

-> In generator_new.java, we can set the various parameters related to Partial Offloading Simulation as specified in Table 2 Simulation parameters in the paper.
