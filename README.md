# Delay-Aware-Partial-Task-Offloading-using-Multicriteria-Decision-Model-in-IoT-Fog-Cloud-Networks
# Execution Environment
Operation System: Microsoft Windows 10, 64bit.
Physical Memory (RAM) 16.0 GB.
# Prerequisites
JDK 1.8- Java Development Kit comprising of Java Runtime Environment to execute java applications.
IFogSim simulator for experimental set up and execution.
# Installation of IFogSim Simulator 
Simulator is available in github repository : **https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim**. Clone the repository in Eclipse IDE and follow the instructions to run the IFogSim simulator provided in the github link.For more details you can refer to the IFogsim Documentation.
One example video about installation for your reference:**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_I-fzHY6qQ**
# Usage of the repository folder
Download  DelayPOMCD and keep it in the drive where IFogsim-main is present. The  DelayPOMCD repository contains all executable files related to the proposed and baseline approaches.
proposed.java -> The Main file related to the  Proposed Algorithm approach.
DATSfinal.java -> The Main file related to the  DATS baseline approach.
post_new.java -> The Main file related to the  POST game theory based approach.
Random.java -> The Main file related to the random offloading approach.  
In generator_new.java, we can set the various parameters related to Partial Offloading Simulation as specified in TAble 2 Simulation parameters in the paper.
